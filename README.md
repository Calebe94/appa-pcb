# Calebe94's Keyboard

This keyboard is inspired by [Plaid](https://github.com/AntonioPelayo/plaid-through-hole-keyboard) and [Gherkin Apls 1.1](https://www.40percent.club/2017/08/gherkin-alps-11.html).

I'm using white APLS switches for this project and Arduino Pro Mini as the core microcontroller.
